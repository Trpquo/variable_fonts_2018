# Variable fonts - presentation 2018
Presentation on OpenType Variable fonts and its applications.

When the new OpenType 1.8 specification was released in the late year 2016, it introduced a whole new technological concept of creating and using digital typefaces. Although the widespread application support has not jet been achieved for the display of text set in so-called variable fonts, nor for variable typeface design; it is already becoming obvious that their practical usage will not stop at reducing the number of font files for a typeface family to one or mere broadening of letter width and the weight specter of a particular font set. This paper will explore the field of foreseeable benefits that variable fonts can bring to accessibility, responsivity and interaction of web pages, relying on the CSS and scripting interfaces that some browser vendors have already implemented in their commercial releases.
